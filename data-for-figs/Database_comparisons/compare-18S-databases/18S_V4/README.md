The assigned-to-mock comparisons were quite unstable for 18S, so rather than doing it programmatically, Emily Curd hand-coded whether the taxonomy assignments were Correct, Ambiguous, or Raw. The raw taxonomy tables are saved under `raw-taxon-tables` (with the exception of raw Silva tables -- Emily?)
